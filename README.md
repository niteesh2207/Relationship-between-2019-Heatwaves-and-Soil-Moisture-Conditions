Soil moisture is a critical component of the global water cycle. It is the key driver of partitioning of rainfall and of radiation (heat). There have been studies which show that there is a link
between soil moisture conditions and surface/air temperature in a region. Northern India experienced a severe heat wave in May-June of 2019, coupled with a severe drought throughout the
country. At a global rate, hot extremes continued to increase during global warming hiatus. Not
only that, these heatwaves indirectly causing stress on agriculture production. Parallel posing a
threat to upcoming country’s food security. At the end, our results predict percentage of rainfall
on specific days to eradicate risks discussed above. Soil moisture involves complex structural
characteristics and meteorological factors, and it is difficult to establish an ideal mathematical
model for soil moisture prediction. Prediction models have problems such as prediction accuracy, generalization, and multi-feature processing capability. In order to solve this , KNN
algorithm is used for generating high accuracy within the small data.The study explains about
prediction model using KNN Algorithm. The results obtained is more than 70 percent accurate
which predicts rainfall on specific days. This is obtained by plotting graphs using ‘Matplotlib’
library. Also, specific graphs are used to predict rainfall on basis of Boolean expression. Remaining graphs are dropped out of equation. This study helps in determining the rainfall as the
pattern of heat waves and warm spells have changed over a period of time.
